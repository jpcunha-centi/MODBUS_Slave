# Devices
This folder is where each device library (or API) folder will be. Each device needs to be 
on its own folder.

## Organization
Inside of each device folder, there are three files that are necessary. Those are:
- **Device.c** \
This file will contain the main code for the device.
- **Device.h** \
This file will contain all the external functions to use the device library.
- **Device_types.h** \
This file will contain all the types used to help to use the device library.
- ***Others*** \
If needed, it can be added more files to help organize the device library.
